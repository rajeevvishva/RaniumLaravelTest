Summary
Neo stands for Near-Earth Objects. Nasa provides an open API and in this problem, we will be using the Asteroid NeoWs API.

We want to plot a line chart showing the number of asteroids passing near the Earth each day for the given date range as well as find the nearest asteroid and the fastest asteroid.


Data Source
